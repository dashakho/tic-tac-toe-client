##Rules
Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

##Development process
I started out by researching how this games was done in the past with JavaScript. Some of the approaches I found were very elaborate with complicated logic. I started my own development process from scratch.

It was fun coding the win conditions logic and testing it. This part went through many interations. I then moved on to the API and event handling part of the game in Jquery. Getting the authentication part of the page to work was a definitely a learning experience. The next stage was ensuring the user messaging works properly, stopping the user the from clicking twice on a cell.

Overall I liked the process to get a chance to have hands of code for a fully functional web application from the beginning to the end.
